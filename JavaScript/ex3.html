    <span id = "first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the <span>ECMAScript</span> specification.[10] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.

    Alongside HTML and CSS, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core <span>technologies</span> of the World Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
    dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on the user's device.
